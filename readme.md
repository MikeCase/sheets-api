Just messing around with google api's. In particular, gmail, drive and sheets api's. 
This app will connect to your gmail, pull a list of emails, add the from address and subject to a spreadsheet.  

To run this, you will need oauth credentials for the api. 

You need the following scopes
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
- https://mail.google.com
